Simulation of 2D and 3D heat flow equations using CUDA.

The code is an implementation of a CUDA program to output the temperature at each grid point after running the equation for a fixed number of time-steps. 

Make changes in the .conf file in the build folder to test the desired cases.

Example execution-

./heat2D3D sample.conf
